# Exploring automation using Python with Selenium

This is base project for exploring Python + Selenium Automation Testing
Prerequisites
1) Install Python : 
    https://www.python.org/downloads/
    Set Python in your system environment variables > Path
2) Install IDE (e.g. Visual Studio Code, Pycharm)
    Visual Studio Code > https://code.visualstudio.com/
3) Install Selenium libraries
4) Install Behave
5) Download web drivers (e.g. chromedriver.exe, geckodriver.exe)

I have elected to use "The Perth Mint" website as the site for testing.  Most of the features being explored for the Python + Selenium automation testing will not require log-in so as other users could also try out running the code.


You need to pip install the following
selenium-page-factory

You could try out the base code by running the jd_pagefactory_example.py.  You could run this by python jd_python_selenium_example.py
