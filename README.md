# Exploring automation using Python with Selenium

This is base project for exploring Python + Selenium Automation Testing

I have elected to use "The Perth Mint" website as the site for testing.  Most of the features being explored for the Python + Selenium automation testing will not require log-in so as other users could also try out running the code.


You need to pip install the following
selenium-page-factory

You could try out the base code by running the jd_pagefactory_example.py.  You could run this by python jd_python_selenium_example.py
